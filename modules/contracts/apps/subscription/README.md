# Subscription App

## Description

This app allows users to create subscriptions that other people can subscribe to. Users provide funds when they subscribe and those funds are used to pay for the subscription for as long as the funds don't run out.

When a user does'n top-up their balance, an external call is made to the `subscription` contract to cancel the subscription. The admin can opt to add a cancellation hook that will be called when the subscription is canceled and which contains the addresses of the now ex-subscribers.

## Why use the Subscription App?

The Subscription App represents a shift towards a more transparent, efficient, and user-controlled subscription model, leveraging the strengths of smart contracts to facilitate direct interactions between content creators and their audiences.

- **Autonomy and Flexibility for Creators and Consumers**: It enables content creators or service providers to create their own subscription models directly, without intermediaries. Consumers can subscribe to these services by pre-funding their subscriptions, giving them flexibility to control their expenditure and commitments.

- **Transparent and Direct Transactions**: Using smart contracts for transactions ensures transparency and direct payments between subscribers and content creators. This reduces the need for third-party payment processors, lowering transaction fees and potentially increasing the revenue for creators.

- **Automated Payments and Subscriptions Management**: The use of smart contracts for managing subscriptions ensures that payments are automatically handled according to the funds available in a subscriber's account. This automation reduces the administrative burden on providers and improves the overall efficiency of the subscription process.

- **Decentralization and Security**: Abstract Apps benefits from the inherent security and decentralization of distributed ledger technologies. This minimizes the risk of fraud, censorship, and centralized control, offering a more resilient platform for both creators and subscribers.

- **Customizable User Experience**: The possibility for an admin to add a cancellation hook provides a customizable user experience. This feature can be used for various purposes, such as notifying users about the cancellation, offering alternatives or promotions to retain them, or even automating certain actions upon subscription cancellation.

- **Enhanced Engagement and Loyalty**: The direct relationship between creators and subscribers, facilitated by this model, can enhance user engagement and loyalty. Creators can directly communicate with their subscriber base, understand their preferences, and tailor their offerings accordingly.

- **Efficient Funds Management**: Subscribers can manage their subscriptions efficiently by pre-funding their accounts. This helps in budgeting for content consumption and reduces the likelihood of unexpected charges, as the subscription only remains active as long as the funds suffice.

- **Incentives for Early or Loyal Subscribers**: The platform could offer mechanisms for rewarding early or loyal subscribers, such as discounts or exclusive content, further enhancing the value proposition for users.

## Features

The subscription app serves three primary functions:

1. Empower businesses to unlock revenue streams with a cutting-edge subscription model.
2. Streamline the allocation of earnings and native assets to your team of contributors, ensuring fair compensation.
3. Enhance user engagement by rewarding active participants with native assets, fostering a vibrant community ecosystem.

## Income

The income generated by our service can fluctuate as new subscribers join and existing ones depart. To ensure our system adapts to these changes in revenue, we've developed a method to monitor income closely. Traditional monthly settlements aren't compatible with blockchain technology, so we've adopted a monthly payment approach instead. We calculate a 'Time-Weighted Average' of income, breaking it down to a per-second basis to get a clear picture of our earnings throughout the month. This process helps us average out the income over each month, allowing us to make informed decisions and adjustments to our infrastructure based on current financial performance.

## Emissions

Protocol emissions play a crucial role in building a close-knit community of users and contributors for your product. The emissions functionality of this module makes it simple to tailor emission settings to suit your requirements. You set these parameters at the time you create the module, and they're detailed within the 'EmissionType' structure, ensuring you have the flexibility to adjust how rewards are distributed within your community.

## Contributions

The contribution feature in our contract is designed to directly reward users who help develop and enhance your product. Every contributor is recognized with specific 'Compensation' settings tailored to them. Here's how it works:

- The system's total revenue is distributed between the organization (DAO) and its contributors, as outlined in the 'ContributionConfig.'
- Optionally, token emissions to contributor (and users) are dynamically set based on the protocol's income. This means if the demand or income decreases, token distributions increase, and they decrease when demand or income goes up.

This approach ensures that those who invest their time and effort into the product are fairly compensated, fostering a motivated community committed to the product's growth.
