# Payment App

## Description

The payment app allows the user to create a "bucket" into which they can get paid in any asset, having it swap to their destination asset. It’s similar to paypal.me, where the user has a payment link.

## Why use the Payment App?

Our state-of-the-art payment application is designed to revolutionize the way transactions are conducted in the digital age. By abstracting the complexities of choosing specific cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, we offer an unprecedented level of flexibility and ease to our users. Upon setting up a "bucket" within our system, you are instantly equipped to receive payments from a broad spectrum of digital assets, according to the preference of your payers.

This innovative approach ensures that you no longer need to navigate the intricate landscape of digital currencies or be limited by the constraints of individual blockchain platforms. Instead, our solution democratizes the payment process, allowing transactions to flow smoothly and efficiently across various cryptocurrencies without the need for technical expertise.

Furthermore, our platform is built with the utmost security measures and state-of-the-art encryption technologies to safeguard your transactions and financial data. With our application, you gain access to a global payment system that is not only flexible but also secure, reliable, and user-friendly, making it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals alike looking to embrace the future of finance.


## Features

- The payment app is “single-chain” meaning that the user can only get paid on one chain. This could be fixed by having the payment app itself create remote accounts (with the payment app) that would create new buckets on other chains to get paid.
