# ETF dApp

ETF is a decentralized application built on the Cosmos blockchain using the Abstract SDK. ETF allows users to create ETFs (custom token funds) and sell shares of their ETF to other users who want to delegate the curation of their assets.

## Description

This dApp is used for buying shares in a portfolio Abstract Account. The owner of the account has permissions to manage the asset allocations. By holding the shares the owner has the right to receive a share of the portfolio's assets, in proportion to the number of shares held.

It uses the proxy's value calculation configuration to get the value of the assets held in the proxy and the relative value of the deposit asset.
It then mints LP tokens that are claimable for an equal portion of the proxy assets at a later date.

## Why use the ETF App?

- ETF allows "expert" users to create custom token ETFs and sell shares to "non-expert" users. "Expert" users receive a small fee for selling a share in their ETF.
- "Non-experts" can find the ETFs with the best returns and buy shares in them.
