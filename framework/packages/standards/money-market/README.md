# Money Market Adapter Trait

A trait that defines a standard interface for Money Market interactions. This trait should be implemented for each Money Market that the adapter supports.

To implement this trait, create a new package, import this crate and implement the trait for your Money Market.

We provide implementations for Mars and Kujira Ghost Protocol in the [integrations](../../../../integrations) folder.
