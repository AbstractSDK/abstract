# MoneyMarket Adapter Trait

A trait that defines a standard interface for MoneyMarket interactions. This trait should be implemented for each Money market that the adapter supports.

To implement this trait, create a new package, import this crate and implement the trait for your Money Market.

We provide implementations for Mars, Kujira Ghost and Cavern Protocol in the [integrations](../../../../integrations) folder.
