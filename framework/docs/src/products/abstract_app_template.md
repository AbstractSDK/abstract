# Abstract App Template

The Abstract App Module Template is a starting point for developing apps that enable features or transform Abstract
Accounts into standalone products.

>For a deeper understanding of Abstract Accounts, please refer to the [abstract accounts](../framework/architecture.md) documentation. If you need a refresher about apps, consult the [app module documentation](../framework/module_types.md).

The primary focus of the Abstract App Template is to provide a template for building a new Abstract App, as well as support for generating TypeScript client code for the contract, which can then be imported into a frontend application.

## Getting Started

To get started, please go to the <a href="https://github.com/AbstractSDK/app-template" target="_blank">Abstract App
Template Github Repo</a> and follow the instructions in the README.

In there you can find instructions on how to generate a new Abstract App, how to test it, deploy it, and generate
TypeScript client code.
