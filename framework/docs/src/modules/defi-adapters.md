# DeFi Adapters

Developers teams shouldn't waste engineering time and capital on integrations. Most DeFi applications rely on the same common protocols, interfaces for which are often re-implemented by every new developer team.

Abstract's DeFi [adapters](../3_framework/6_module_types.md#adapters) allow developers to write applications _agnostic_ of the underlying DeFi primitive so that they're portable to any new protocol, regardless of their APIs.

Adapters offered by Abstract currently include:

- [Dex](./dex.md)
- [Lending Market](./lending-market.md)
- [CW Staking](./cw-staking.md)
