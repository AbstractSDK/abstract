### Welcome to Abstract, the interchain CosmWasm development platform. </br>We are building tools and infrastructure for composable smart-contract applications. 

</div> -->

## What Is The Abstract Platform?

The Abstract platform is your one-stop solution for streamlined CosmWasm smart-contract development. We provide an
integrated smart-contract framework, continuous deployment tools, robust data management solutions for both on-chain and
off-chain needs, and top-tier infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings.

Our products are designed to be composable, allowing you to re-use the components you need to build your applications.
While Abstract aims to simplify the development experience, it functions as a powerful tool, enabling you to innovate
with
less effort.

```admonish info
In this page you are given an overview of the Abstract platform and its products. You can skip the introduction and go 
straight to the [Getting Started](./4_get_started/1_index.md) guide if you're already familiar with the platform.

## Why Build with Abstract?

Building decentralized applications is hard! We know this because we've been there. We've spent countless hours building
applications on the Cosmos ecosystem, and we've created Abstract with all the lessons we learned along the way to make
it
easier and faster to build for you.

- **Based on CosmWasm** 🌟: The Abstract SDK is built on top of the [CosmWasm][1]{target="_blank"} smart-contract
  framework,
  which has been battle-tested
  and proven to be secure and reliable. This also means that you can leverage the existing tooling and community to
  accelerate your development process.


- **Chain-Agnostic** 🌐: The Abstract platform can support any CosmWasm-based network, even outside the Cosmos ecosystem,
  giving you the flexibility to choose the best-suited platform for your dApp.


- **Modular Design** 🧩: Abstract's modular architecture allows you to choose from a curated library of smart-contract or
  develop your own using the Abstract SDK, enabling rapid development and customization. Think of Abstract as a lego set
  for
  building decentralized applications, connect the pieces you need and voilà!.


- **Custom Governance** 🗳️: All Abstract Accounts can be governed by any entity tailored to your application's specific
  requirements. Currently, the Console supports soverign, cw3-flex-multisig, and DaoDao-governed Accounts.


- **Development Tooling** 🛠: Abstract offers a vast integration testing library, enabling you to quickly increase test
  coverage
  and ensure the reliability of your dApps.


- **Version Management** 🔄: Abstract simplifies the process of managing smart-contract versioning, ensuring you can
  quickly
  release and access new features and bug-fixes.


- **Ecosystem Integrations** 🌱: Abstract is designed to work seamlessly with protocols, projects, and services in the
  ever-expanding IBC ecosystem; from DEXes, order-books, NFT-marketplaces, to wallets, we got it all!. If you want to
  know more about our integrations, check out the [Integrations](10_integrations.md) section.
