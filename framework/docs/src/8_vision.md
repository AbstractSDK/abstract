# What is Abstract?

Abstract is a framework that empowers developers to create secure and powerful decentralized applications
in the Cosmos ecosystem with ease. With Abstract, you can unleash your creativity and build innovative solutions without
much
of the complexities typically associated with blockchain development.

## Simplified Development

Abstract simplifies the development process by providing a modular architecture and a comprehensive set of tools both
for
the **frontend and backend**. We believe that developers should be able to focus on building their applications, rather
than
spending time on repetitive tasks. There's no need to reinvent the wheel! Developers can leverage pre-built
functionalities
and templates for both the frontend and smart contracts to accelerate application development. Abstract's modular
approach
allows you to focus on the specific features and logic of your application, reducing development time and effort.

## Secure and Reliable Infrastructure

Abstract offers secure and reliable infrastructure for smart-contract development. Modules available on the registry are
thoroughly tested and audited by security experts, ensuring that your applications are built on a solid foundation.
Building a CosmWasm smart-contract with the Abstract SDK automatically makes it more secure, with an "off-by-default"
permission system, fully configurable by you.

## Seamless Integration with Financial Services

With Abstract, you can seamlessly integrate your applications with any financial service available on the interchain.
Whether you're
building decentralized lending platforms, automated market makers, or yield farming protocols, Abstract provides the
necessary tools and interoperability to connect with existing protocols and applications. This allows you to tap
into the vast ecosystem of DeFi and provide users with a seamless and comprehensive financial experience.

## Continuous Funding

Developers on the Abstract platform can earn ongoing revenue for their contributions by leveraging the platform's
community-driven incentives. As a developer you can publish your smart contract modules on the marketplace and receive
proceeds directly from sales to other teams via subscription or one-time fee. By participating in or forming Developer
DAOs,
developers gain access to funding for building smart contracts and dApps, sharing profits among members. Furthermore,
individual developers can fulfill user-created bounties, earning real assets for their efforts. This collaborative
environment
encourages the creation of top-quality smart contracts, offering developers a continuous income stream and promoting
value for all parties involved.

developers, share knowledge, and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. Together, we can push the boundaries of
what's possible in the world of decentralized finance and drive the industry forward.
