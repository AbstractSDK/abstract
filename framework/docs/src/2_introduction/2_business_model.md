# Business Model

Abstract business model is deeply involved with Decentralised Finance (DeFi), with a significant focus on DeFi adapters, each of which incurs a service fee. It also allows us, as a business to scale our operations and innovate on offerings in midst of ever-evolving market demands and technological advancements.
Given the critical role our adapters play, our business model incorporates a structured service fee system, applicable to different types of transactions conducted through various interfaces.

Here is a breakdown of the service fees associated with different types of transactions:

### DEX Adapter

In our Decentralised Exchange (DEX) adapter, we implement a service fee structure where a charge of **0.3%** is levied on each swap transaction. This fee is calculated as a proportion of the total transaction amount, which implies that the absolute fee amount increases with the size of the transaction. In practical terms, this means that for larger transactions, the fee paid will be higher in absolute numbers, while for smaller transactions, the fee will be correspondingly lower.

This fee model is strategic for several reasons. First, it aligns our revenue with the volume of transactions processed through our platform, incentivising us to continuously enhance the platform's performance and reliability. Second, it offers a clear and predictable fee structure for users, helping them to understand the cost implications of their transactions upfront.

Our DEX adapter is designed to provide users with a smooth and efficient interface for conducting swap transactions within the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It is optimised for seamless integration with various blockchain networks and DeFi protocols, ensuring that users can execute their transactions with ease and reliability. By using our platform, users benefit from the robust technical infrastructure, which supports high transaction throughput and minimizes the risk of slippage or failed transactions.

Additionally, the fee model serves as an incentive for users to choose our platform for their swap transactions. By offering a competitive fee structure, combined with high-performance transaction processing, we aim to attract a broad user base, ranging from individual traders to large institutions. This approach not only enhances liquidity on our platform but also contributes to the overall efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem.

### Money Market Adapter

In the context of interest repayments processed via our Money Market adapter, we impose a standard service fee of **0.3%**. This fee is levied as a percentage of the total repayment amount and is deducted at the time of transaction processing. The stated rate of **0.3%** serves as the baseline for the service charge, but it's important to note that this rate is not fixed and can be subject to adjustments.

The actual fee rate may vary depending on several factors. For instance, specific agreements or contracts between our company and the client can stipulate a different fee rate, either higher or lower than the standard. Such agreements might be influenced by the volume of transactions, the duration of the business relationship, or negotiated terms that reflect a mutual understanding of value and service expectations.

Also, policy changes within our organisation can lead to adjustments in the service fee rate. These changes could be driven by market dynamics, regulatory requirements, operational costs, or strategic decisions aimed at aligning our services with market conditions and business objectives.

Clients are advised to refer to their service agreement for precise fee details and to stay informed about any potential changes through official communications from our company. This ensures transparency and helps maintain a clear understanding of the financial aspects of our service offerings.
