# Business Model

Abstract's business model is firmly grounded in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), with a particular emphasis on DeFi adapters, which attract service fees. This innovative model enables us to navigate and adapt swiftly in response to changing market needs and emerging technologies, enhancing our operational scalability.
Given the essential function of these adapters, our business model integrates a well-defined service fee system. This system applies to a variety of transactions carried out via numerous interfaces, thereby ensuring smooth operations and facilitating ongoing innovation in our offerings.

Here is a breakdown of the service fees associated with different types of transactions:

### DEX Adapter

Our Decentralized Exchange (DEX) adapter implements a service fee structure that charges a rate of 0.3% on each swap transaction. This fee is calculated as a percentage of the total transaction amount, which means the fee amount increases or decreases proportionately with the size of the transaction.

This fee model aligns with our strategic goals in several ways. First, it ties our revenue to the volume of transactions processed through our platform, motivating us to continually improve platform performance and reliability. Second, it provides users with a transparent and predictable fee structure, allowing them to anticipate the cost implications of their transactions in advance.

Our DEX adapter is engineered to facilitate smooth and efficient swap transactions within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It enables seamless integration with various blockchain networks and DeFi protocols, ensuring users can execute transactions with ease and confidence. Utilizing our platform offers access to robust technical infrastructure designed for high transaction throughput and minimizes the risk of slippage or failed transactions.

Moreover, the fee model incentivizes users to choose our platform for their swap transactions. By providing a competitive fee structure coupled with high-performance transaction processing, we aim to attract a wide range of users, from individual traders to large institutions. This approach enhances liquidity on our platform and contributes to the overall efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem.

### Money Market Adapter

Our Money Market adapter applies a standard service fee of 0.3% to interest repayments processed through it. This fee is charged as a percentage of the total repayment amount and is deducted at the time of transaction processing. The 0.3% rate serves as the baseline fee but may be subject to change under certain conditions.

The actual fee rate may differ based on various factors. For example, specific agreements or contracts between our company and the client may dictate a different fee rate than the standard, either higher or lower. Such agreements may be influenced by transactional volume, length of business relationship, or negotiated terms reflecting a mutual understanding of value and service expectations.

Additionally, adjustments in the service fee rate may result from policy changes within our organization. These changes could be driven by market dynamics, regulatory requirements, operational costs, or strategic decisions aimed at aligning our services with market conditions and business objectives.

To ensure transparency, clients are advised to review their service agreement for exact fee details and stay informed about any potential changes through official communications from our company. This approach maintains a clear understanding of the financial aspects of our service offerings.
