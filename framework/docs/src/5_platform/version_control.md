# Version Control

The Version Control contract acts as the registry for all modules and accounts within the Abstract platform. Abstract
Accounts can use it to claim namespaces and register their modules. The Version Control contract allows modules to be
queried by its namespace, name, and version, returning its reference which may be a code id or address.
