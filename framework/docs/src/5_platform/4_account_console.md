### Claim a Namespace

Now that you have your account you can proceed to claim your namespace. The namespace will be exclusively linked to your
Abstract Account and will prefix your module names to form a unique module identifier.

> For example, if your namespace is `myapp` and your module name is `mymodule` then your module identifier will
> be `myapp:mymodule`.

You can easily claim your namespace by going to your Account on our website and click the "Claim Namespace" button on
the account page. You will be asked to pay a small fee to claim your namespace. This fee is used to prevent namespace
squatting and to help us maintain the Abstract ecosystem.
