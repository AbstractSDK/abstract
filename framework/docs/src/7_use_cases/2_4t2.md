# FortyTwo Autocompounder

FortyTwo, winner of the Cosmoverse 2023 pitch contest, aims to simplify access to the Cosmos ecosystem, acting as an
entry point and yield aggregator for all IBC-enabled chains. It provides a unified user interface for yield farming, liquidity optimization, and portfolio tracking.

FortyTwo built a dex-agnostic autocompounder application on Abstract, allowing for autocompounding any LP position in the interchain ecosystem.
