# XION

[XION](https://xion.burnt.com) is consumer-oriented chain focused on eliminating the complexities of Web3 interaction through "generalized abstraction," offering users the ability to interact with apps and liquidity on any chain.

XION uses Abstract's [ICAAs](../3_framework/8_ibc.md) to enable chain abstraction and for full control and programmability of any chain over IBC.
