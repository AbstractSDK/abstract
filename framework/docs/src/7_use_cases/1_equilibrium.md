# Equilibrium

Equilibrium, dubbed as "The Cosmos Rebalancer" and awarded at HackWasm 2022, operates an auto-rebalancing protocol to
facilitate creation of weighted portfolios of Cosmos assets, with portfolio allocations auto-adjusted per market
fluctuations. The protocol is built using the Abstract SDK as a foundation as well as the CronCat protocol, and aims to
boost liquidity within the Atom Economic Zone. Equilibrium's contracts are highly composable, audited for security, and
enable innovative financial products on the Neutron blockchain. This initiative seeks to align with Neutron's core
values and enhance its ecosystem by attracting investments, liquidity, and maximizing Miner Extractable Value (MEV)
opportunities.
