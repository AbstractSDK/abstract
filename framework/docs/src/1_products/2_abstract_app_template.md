# Abstract App Template

The Abstract App Module Template is a starting point for developing apps that enable features or transform Abstract
Accounts into standalone products. An app is instantiated for each Account individually and it's migratable. Apps are
allowed to perform actions on the Account and may also integrate with other apps and Adapters installed on the Account.
For a deeper understanding of Abstract Accounts, please refer to
the [abstract accounts](../3_framework/3_architecture.md)
documentation. If you're interested in learning about apps, consult
the [app module documentation](../3_framework/6_module_types.md).

The primary focus of the Abstract App Template as of now is to provide a template for building a new Abstract App, as
well
as support for generating TypeScript client code for the contract, which can then be imported into a frontend
application.

In the future, the Abstract App Template will also provide a basic template for the frontend application.

## Getting Started

To get started, please go to the <a href="https://github.com/AbstractSDK/app-template" target="_blank">Abstract App
Template Github Repo</a>
and follow the instructions in the README.

In there you can find instructions on how to generate a new Abstract App, how to test it, deploy it, and generate
TypeScript client code.
