# The Interchain Application Stack

Abstract aims to make the full-stack CosmWasm app developer's life as easy as possible. Building on Abstract means building on the interchain.

To accomplish this, we provide Cosmwasm tooling for every vertical, including:


### [Interchain App Template (Full-Stack)](2_abstract_app_template.md)

- **Quick Start**: Jumpstart your app development with our robust template.
- **Integration Friendly**: Easy to integrate with existing systems.
- **TypeScript Support**: Build with confidence using TypeScript.


## Smart-Contracts

### [CosmWasm Framework](5_framework.md)

The Abstract SDK is a framework for modular CosmWasm application development. It provides the means to build smart-contract "lego-blocks" that are composed to build applications.

### [CW-Orchestrator (Testing)](1_cw_orchestrator.md)

Fully Rust-native CosmWasm scripting, testing and deployment library. Integrates multiple environments with a unified and intuitive interface.

## Middleware

### [Abstract GraphQL API ](6_api.md)

A GraphQL API for accessing all of Abstract from anywhere. Supports custom configurations for any CosmWasm network with Abstract.

### Typescript Interface Generation

Typescript generation tooling built on top of [Cosmology](https://cosmology.tech)'s CosmWasm [ts-codegen](https://github.com/CosmWasm/ts-codegen), specifically geared towards application developers. It wraps the CosmWasm and Abstract clients, and enables one-line interfacing with Abstract applications.

## Frontend

### [Typescript Libraries](4_abstract_js.md)

- **Seamless Interactions**: Engage with the blockchain from your web application effortlessly.
- **Type Declarations**: Develop with type safety in mind.
- **Comprehensive**: From queries to transactions, we've got you covered.

### [Developer Console](7_console.md)

A developer console created to simplify development and management of Abstract Accounts and applications.
