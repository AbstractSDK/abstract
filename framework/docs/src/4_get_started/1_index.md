# Abstract SDK - How to get started

This tutorial will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment, creating an [App Module](../3_framework/6_module_types.md#apps), and deploying your first app to our on-chain registry with [cw-orchestrator](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-orchestrator).

## Prerequisites

1. A minimal understanding of Rust is expected. If you are new to Rust, you can find a great introduction to the language in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" target="_blank">The Rust Book</a>.

2. The Abstract SDK is built using the CosmWasm smart-contract framework. If you are new to CosmWasm, you can find a great introduction to the framework in the <a href="https://book.cosmwasm.com/" target="_blank">CosmWasm Book</a>.

3. Abstract also makes extensive use of [cw-orchestrator](../1_products/1_cw_orchestrator.md), our CosmWasm scripting library. You can read its documentation <a href="https://orchestrator.abstract.money/" target="_blank">here</a>.
