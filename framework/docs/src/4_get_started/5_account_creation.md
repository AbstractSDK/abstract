# Becoming a Publisher

A publisher is an entity that publishes modules to the Abstract platform. Publishers can be individuals, teams, or AI robots. The only requirement is that they have an Abstract Account with a Namespace.

But how? I hear you whisper to yourself. Well, we've made it really easy for you. All you need to do is follow the instructions below.

## Creating an Abstract Account

The first step to becoming a publisher is creating an Abstract Account.

You can either do this through our [web-app](https://console.abstract.money) or you can use the script that we've conveniently provided for you.

The script we'll outline here is provided in the app-template `deploy.rs` file. You can find it [here](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/abstract/blob/main/app-template/examples/publish.rs)

A module namespace is your (or your team's) publishing domain for Abstract modules. Through this design you can monetize your product through a namespace or per-modules basis as explained in more detail in the [monetization](../5_platform/6_monetization.md) section.

## Monetization
We know you're really excited to start playing with your module but there's one more thing you need to do first.
Abstract cares about your efforts, and we believe you should have the ability to monetize your modules in any way that
you see fit. To help us provide that feature we created the concept of **module namespaces**. 

Each namespace must be associated with an Abstract Account, hence you will need to create one.

To create an Abstract Account and claim your Namespace, please follow the instructions in
this [section](../5_platform/4_account_console.md#accessing-the-account-console).
