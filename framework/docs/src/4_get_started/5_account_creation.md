# Account Creation

We know you're really excited to start playing with your module but there's one more thing you need to do first.
Abstract cares about your efforts, and we believe you should have the ability to monetize your modules in any way that
you see fit. To help us provide that feature we created the concept of **module namespaces**. A module namespace is
your (or your team's) publishing domain for Abstract modules. Through this design you can monetize your product through
a namespace or per-modules basis as explained in more detail in the [monetization](../5_platform/6_monetization.md) section.

Each namespace must be associated with an Abstract Account, hence you will need to create one.

To create an Abstract Account and claim your Namespace, please follow the instructions in
this [section](../5_platform/4_account_console.md#accessing-the-account-console).

With the Abstract Account and Namespace setup out of the way let's get to the fun part: building your module!
