# Module Types

Within the Abstract SDK, a _module_ is a contract that **adds functionality** to your Abstract Account. You can explore
all the available modules on the modules tab of your Account through
the <a href="https://app.abstract.money/" target="_blank">web-app</a>.

```admonish info
In the previous sections we referred to these modules as "applications". We did this to simplify the mental framework of 
the Abstract SDK. However, the term "application" is not entirely accurate, instead we should refer to them as "modules". 
These modules come in different types, each with their own purpose. The most common of which is the "App" module, or 
"Abstract App".
```

Modules are classified in the following categories:

- **App**: modules that add a functionality, exposing new entry-points for you or your users.
- **Adapter**: modules that act as a standard interface between your Account and external services.
- **Standalone**: modules not built within Abstract, but registered to your Account so that the manager can execute
  commands on them.

## Apps

An App module adds additional functionality to your Abstract Account, exposing new entry-points for you or your users.
This could range from adding advanced financial logic, data management features, or complex computation capabilities,
depending on your application's needs.

Each App module is exclusive to a single Abstract Account, **meaning the instance is owned by the Account owner**,
ensuring
the owner has full control over the module's functionality and lifecycle. This level of control extends to the
management of upgrades, maintenance, and any customization that might be required for the specific use case of the
application.

Because each Account has its own instance, App modules can be tightly integrated with the Account's existing
infrastructure. This includes the ability to interact directly with other modules within the same account, enabling
powerful synergies and cross-module functionality.

> The `abstract:etf` module is an app that exposes entry-points allowing external users to buy and sell "shares" in your
> Account, representing a portion of the Accounts' value.

## Adapters

Adapters serve as standard interfaces that facilitate communication between your Abstract Account and various external
services. They act like bridges, enabling your account to interact with different smart contracts and blockchain
services, thereby enhancing the interoperability of your applications.

The key function of an Adapter is to generalize functionality. Regardless of the underlying blockchain or smart contract
protocol, the Adapter provides a standard interface that maintains consistency and simplifies the interaction process.
As such, Adapters significantly simplify the developer experience and reduce the time required to integrate with various
external systems.

Unlike other modules specific to each Abstract Account, Adapters are "global" in nature. This means that they are shared
between multiple accounts. Due to this, **Adapter modules are not migratable**. This design choice is aimed at
preventing supply-chain attacks that could potentially compromise the security of the Abstract ecosystem.

While individual Abstract Account owners can decide which Adapters and versions they wish to utilize, the overall
control and maintenance of Adapters are handled at a platform level. This approach ensures that Adapters remain
reliable, secure, and consistent across all Accounts.

> The `abstract:dex` module allows Accounts to access standard functions on dexes with the same interface, regardless of
> whether they're local to the chain or across IBC.

## Installing and Uninstalling Modules

The following are sequence diagrams of the process of installing and uninstalling a module on an Abstract Account. As
you can see, the process happens via the Manager, and it can be done by the Account owner through
the [web-app](https://app.abstract.money/).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as Owner
    participant M as Manager
    participant MF as Module Factory
    participant VC as Version Control
    participant P as Proxy
    U ->> M: InstallModule
    M ->> MF: InstallModule
    MF -->>+ VC: Query reference
    alt adapter
        VC -->>+ MF: Return address
    else app / standalone
        VC -->>- MF: Return code_id
        MF -> MF: Instantiate module
    end
    MF ->> M: Register module address
    M ->> P: Update module allowlist
```

## How to Use Modules in Your Project

Leveraging modules in your project can significantly simplify the development process, allowing you to deploy projects
faster and more cost-effectively than building traditionally. By using pre-built, tested, and community-reviewed
modules, you can focus on your project's unique features while reducing development time and minimizing potential bugs.

Here's an example of how modules can be leveraged for a decentralized finance (DeFi) project:

Imagine you want to create a DeFi application with the following features:

- A fungible token for your platform
- Staking and delegation functionality
- A governance system for community-driven decision-making
- Integration with an oracle for fetching off-chain data

Instead of building each feature from scratch, you can leverage Abstract's off-the-shelf modules to implement these
functionalities with ease. This not only saves time and resources but also ensures that your project benefits from the
best practices established by the Abstract community.

**Step 1**

Choose the module of your choice on the Abstract SDK. You can see the available modules on
our <a href="https://github.com/AbstractSDK/abstract/tree/main/modules" target="_blank">repository</a>.

**Step 2**

Import the chosen modules into your project and configure them according to your requirements. This can
include setting custom parameters, such as token supply, staking rewards, or voting thresholds.

**Step 3**

Integrate the modules with your existing codebase, ensuring they work seamlessly with your project's unique
features. This can involve calling module functions, implementing hooks, or extending your data structures.

**Step 4**

Test your dApp thoroughly to ensure the modules function as intended and do not introduce any unexpected
behavior.

By leveraging Abstract's modules in this way, you can rapidly build and deploy your DeFi project while benefiting from
the robustness and flexibility of the Abstract ecosystem.

## Execute on Modules

The following are sequence diagrams of the process of executing a module on an Abstract Account. There are three types
of
execution: Owner Execution, Adapter Execution, and Module Execution.

Let's explore each of them.

## Owner Execution

To execute a message on a specific module, the Owner can call the `ExecOnModule` function on the Manager, providing
the module id. This diagram depicts how the Manager interacts with any module installed on the account.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as Owner
    participant M as Manager
    participant Md as Module ("addr123")
    U ->> M: ExecOnModule
    Note right of U: ModuleMsg {"module_id": "xyz"}
    M -->> M: Load module address
    M ->> Md: Execute
    Note right of M: ModuleMsg {"module_addr": "addr123"}
```

## Adapter Execution

In the following example, the `abstract:dex` module is installed on an Account, and the owner requests a swap on a dex.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as Owner
    participant M as Manager
    participant D as abstract:dex
    participant VC as Version Control
    participant A as ANS
    participant P as Proxy
    participant T as Dex Pool
    U ->> M: ExecOnModule
    Note right of U: Dex::Swap
    M --> M: Load module address
    M ->> D: Call module
    Note right of M: Adapter Msg
    D -->+ VC: Load proxy address for Account
    VC -->- D: Address
    D -->>+ A: Resolve asset names
    A -->> D: Asset infos
    D --> A: Resolve dex pool
    A -->>- D: Pool metadata
    D --> D: Build swap msg for target dex
    D ->> P: Forward execution
    Note over VC, A: DexMsg
    P ->> T: Execute
    Note right of P: DexMsg

```

## Module Execution

In this example, we use [Equilibrium](../7_use_cases/1_equilibrium.md)'s `Rebalance` function as an example. Modules
with dependencies (`equilibrium:balancer` is dependent on `abstract:etf` and `abstract:dex`) have their addresses
dynamically resolved when called.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as User
    participant B as equilibrium:balancer
    participant P as Proxy
    participant M as Manager
    participant D as abstract:dex
    participant T as Target Dex
    U ->> B: Rebalance
    B -->>+ P: Query Allocations
    P -->>- B: Allocations
    B --> B: Calculate rebalancing requirements
    B -->>+ M: Query abstract:dex address
    M -->>- B: Address
    B ->> D: Call SwapRouter on dex
    D --> D: Build swap msg for target dex
    D --> D: Load proxy address
    D ->> P: Forward execution
    Note over M: DexMsg
    P ->> T: Execute
    Note over D, M: DexMsg

```
