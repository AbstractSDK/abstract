<!-- This page is a high-level overview of the Abstract Platform, not the SDK or any of our actual products. Hence we should stick to a vocabulary that is familiar to the reader. -->

Welcome to the Abstract Documentation!

**Abstract is an account-based smart-contract development and distribution platform. Our platform and tooling allow developers to build and scale their applications in a chain-agnostic manner.**

This first part of our documentation aims to provide you with the conceptual knowledge you need to understand the Abstract framework. The second part is a step-by-step guide on how to use the Abstract SDK to build your decentralized application.

## Who is Abstract For?

The Abstract SDK is designed for organizations and individual developers who want to build composable distributed applications in a fast, secure, and cost-effective manner.

We expect developers to be familiar with the Rust programming language and general programming concepts.

## Abstract Products

- **[Abstract SDK](3_framework/1_abstract_sdk.md)**: The Abstract Software Development Kit (SDK) is a Rust library that is tightly integrated with Abstract's on-chain infrastructure. By using the SDK, developers can easily perform accounting-based operations and interactions with other smart contracts.

- **[cw-orchestrator](1_products/1_cw_orchestrator.md)**: A developer tool that simplifies the testing and deployment of smart contracts.

- **[Abstract JS](1_products/4_abstract_js.md)**: A JavaScript library that facilitates smart-contract interactions from a browser-based environment.

Together these products form a complete end-to-end development platform for distributed applications.
