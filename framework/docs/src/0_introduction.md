<!-- # The Abstract Development Platform -->
<!-- This page is a high-level overview of the Abstract Platform, not the SDK or any of our actual products. Hence we should stick to a vocabulary that is familiar to the reader. -->

Welcome to the Abstract Documentation!

**Abstract is an account-based application distribution and development platform. Our platform and tooling allow developers to build and scale their applications in a chain-abstracted manner.**

This first part of our documentation aims to provide you with the conceptual knowledge you need to understand the Abstract platform. The second part is a step-by-step guide on how to use the Abstract SDK to build your decentralized applications.

## Who is Abstract For?

### Chains

For chains, we offer [chain abstraction](./3_framework/2_chain_abstraction.md) and [Abstract Accounts](./3_framework/2_account_abstraction.md) for effective user acquisition and engagement. Every chain with Abstract integrated has access to all apps developed with the [Abstract SDK](3_framework/1_abstract_sdk.md).

### Protocols

For protocols, we offer [on-chain application infrastructure](./5_platform/index.md) for single + multi-chain application development and lifecycle management. We also maintain [DeFi adapters](./modules/defi-adapters.md) for Dexes, lending markets, and staking providers.

### App Developers

For app developers, we offer the [Abstract SDK](3_framework/1_abstract_sdk.md), the leading CosmWasm framework designed for organizations and individual developers who want to build composable distributed applications in a fast, secure, and cost-effective manner.

We expect developers to be familiar with the Rust programming language and general programming concepts.

## Abstract Products

- **[Abstract SDK](3_framework/1_abstract_sdk.md)**: Modular CosmWasm framework for developing composable and scalable dapps agnostic to chains and protocols.

- **[Application Infrastructure](./5_platform/index.md)**: On-chain infrastructure for application management.

- **[Abstract Accounts](./3_framework/3_architecture.md)**: Modular smart-contract accounts.

- **[Abstract Interchain](3_framework/8_ibc.md)**: Interchain infrastructure and smart-contract abstractions for building multi-chain applications easily.

- **[Abstract.js](1_products/4_abstract_js.md)**: TypeScript and React libraries for building full-stack Abstract dapps.

- **[cw-orchestrator](1_products/1_cw_orchestrator.md)**: The most advanced CosmWasm scripting, testing, and deployment tool, written fully in Rust.


Together these products form a complete end-to-end development platform for distributed applications.
